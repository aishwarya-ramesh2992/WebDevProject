                        <p>Hi! I am Aishwarya! My family and friends call me aisha or aishu for short :) I was born in Chennai, India on 07/04/2002 aka the happiest day of my parents life. I lived in Chennai for 8 years, then we moved to Dayton, Ohio. We lived there for 2 years and then moved to Denver, Colorado. Denver will always be special to me as that is where we got introduced to the church. 2 years later, we moved to Frisco, Texas and we have lived there ever since. And now I am in Provo for college here at BYU!</p>

                        <h4>My Friends</h4>
                        <center><img src = "../images/img/bffs.jpeg" height = "300" alt = "my bestfriends"></center>
                        <p>Friends are Family! I am so greatful for all the people I have gotten to meet in my lifetime, but I am even more greatful for the people that go through this life with me, my bestfriends. My bestfriends are my sister ramya, and my roommate SJ. Ramya and SJ have been there for me through thick and thin, if I ever need someone to talk to, they are always there. They help me enjoy my life more. Ramya is my built in bestfriend and SJ is my soul sister.</p>
                        <br>
                        
                        <h4>My Mission</h4>
                        <center><img src = "../images/img/manti temple.JPG" height = "250" width = "220" alt = "My favorite temple, the manti temple"></center>
                        <p>It took me a long time to decide to go on a mission and now it is a month away! I am excited to start home MTC, and then go to the actual MTC and then go to California. Being introduced to the church has been the single most greatest blessing in my life and I cannot wait to share that blessing with others in Arcadia California!I love this gospel and my savior and I cannot wait to go teach people about the restored gospel. I also wanted to serve a mission because I love doing service! It is so fulfilling to make a difference in other people's lives. It is so true that when you are in the service of others, you are in the service of God.</p>
